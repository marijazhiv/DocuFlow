**DocuFlow** 

**DocuFlow** is a web application for managing and organizing technical documentation within engineering projects. It is designed to streamline collaboration between engineers, managers, and QA teams by providing a modern and efficient system for tracking document versions and workflows. 

**Project Overview** 

DocuFlow was developed as part of a full-stack software engineering internship project. The main goal was to create a practical and intuitive solution for handling a large volume of technical files (PDF, DWG, DOCX, etc.) and users, while ensuring version control and document traceability. 

**Key Features** 

* Upload documents with **automatic versioning**   
* View **document history and change log**   
* Download and preview documents   
* Add and read **comments** on document versions   
* Manage document **statuses** through an approval workflow:   
* Approved    
* Rejected / Sent for revision    
* Archived    
* **Automatic deletion** of documents that remain archived for too long   
* Full **user authentication** and **role-based access control**   
* **Admin panel** for managing users and their roles 

**Tech Stack** 

* **Backend:** ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8\)   
* **Frontend:** Angular   
* **Database:** PostgreSQL   
* **Authentication:** JWT-based   
* **Architecture:** RESTful API, layered backend structure 

**Future Plans** 

DocuFlow is planned to be deployed to **cloud infrastructure** to ensure better availability, scalability, and adaptability to larger user bases and business use cases. Potential future improvements include: 

* Real-time notifications   
* Integration with cloud storage providers   
* Enhanced role permissions   
* Audit logs and activity tracking
